# Sugar Cubes

Since the purpose of that project is to sharpen **YOUR**Â frontend abilities, it would be a personal diservice to cheat and copy any solutions presented here.

## Why is the repo called sugar cubes?

If you search Google Images for the term **fullstack developer** you'll

As a self identifying fullstack developer, needless to say I felt attacked  ðŸ˜‚.  It was like that Lauryn Hill song, Killing Me Softly,

> Strumming my pain with his fingers...Telling my whole life with his words

Dramatic theatrics aside, it was a reminder I was lacking sufficient frontend capabilities and needed to 'flesh out' my... 'mane' trouble spots (ðŸ˜Ž you'll be forgiven if you've had enough). I lucked up and came across the wonderful project [Frontloops](https://frontloops.io/) by Dmitry Belyaev. It presents you with common UI patterns through email in the form of a png mockup and accompanying video of any interactive specifications. Because they were small, bit-size snippets I intended to use for the front of the above horse, I chose sugar cubes. Makes sense right?



## Repo Structure

The frontloops project has the concept of **loops** and **steps**. There are 3 loops each with 10 steps. I've implemented my solutions for both the Markup and Elements series as branches with a common naming pattern. **For the first step in loop 1 of the markup series, the branch is named `mrkup-L01-S01`**. Following this convention allowed me to write some scripts to automate some development task.
